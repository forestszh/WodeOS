How to Get ttylinux Help
========================


If you have some question(s) about using ttylinux, or some general ttylinux
question, then:

     FIRST - read the ttylinux User Guide at http://ttylinux.net/docs.html

     then, if you still have a question(s) or want more information, email the
     ttylinux mail list:  ttylinux@googlegroups.com
                          http://groups.google.com/group/ttylinux/

     There is a web-based forum that is no longer active, but it may have an
     answer to some issue or question you have; you can try searching it.

          http://www.minimalinux.org/forum/

     Help may be available on irc, which is very low bandwidth and seemingly
     more appropriate for inane banter that sometimes is fun.

          irc.freenode.net #ttylinux
