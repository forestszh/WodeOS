1. ttylinux build-system scripts

These are all the files used to _build_ a ttylinux system that are developed
by the ttylinux project; these are not the files that are delivered with a
bootable ttylinux system such as CD-ROM image or other tar-file.  These files
include, but are not limited to:

=> ttylinux-build/Makefile
=> shell script files in the various directories in ttylinux-build/bootloader/ 
=> ttylinux-build/doc/Makefile
=> the "bld.sh" shell script files in the directories in ttylinux-build/pkg-cfg/
=> shell script files in ttylinux-build/scripts

These ttylinux build-system scripts are copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any
other people wherein noted, who wrote them.  These files are licensed under the
GPL Version 2 (June 1991), not version 2.2 or version 3.x or any other version,
unless explicitly otherwise stated.

        --------------------------------------------------

2. ttylinux build-system configuration files

There are various configuration files used during a ttylinux build process;
these files are read by the make or bash programs (or any other programs so
used) under the programming direction of the various ttylinux build scripts.
These files are not considered to be "executable" as are the build scripts.

These files include, but are not limited to:

=> any file so used in the various directories in ttylinux-build/bootloader/
=> the configuration files in the various directories in ttylinux-build/config/
=> the "files" files in the various directories in ttylinux-build/pkg-cfg/
=> ttylinux-build/ttylinux-config.sh
=> ttylinux-build/ttylinux-pkglst.txt

As any non-trivial thing written, these files are copyrighted; they are
copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any other people wherein noted, who wrote
them.  These files are licensed under any "do whatever you want with" license
you can find or create; they are provided without any restriction.

        --------------------------------------------------

3. ttylinux run-time system scripts and configuration files

There ttylinux run-time system scripts and configuration files are part of a
delivered ttylinux system; they are in the bootable ttylinux CD-ROM image or
tar-file containing the bootable ttylinux system.  These files do reside in the
ttylinux build-system directory structure; they are put into the ttylinux
run-time system during a build process.

In the ttylinux build-system directory structure, these files include, but are
not limited to:

=> any file so used in the various directories in ttylinux-build/bootloader/
=> any file so used in the various directories in ttylinux-build/config/
=> any file so used in the various directories in ttylinux-build/pkg-cfg/

NOTICE -> The various ttylinux run-time system scripts and configuration files
          used as described in this section that are in the various directories
          in:

          => ttylinux-build/bootloader/
          => ttylinux-build/config/

          are intended to be changed as needed by ttylinux end-users and people
          making their own custom ttylinux builds.  Although, ANY CHANGES TO
          THESE FILES MAY RESULT IN A SYSTEM THAT WILL NOT BOOT, OR HAVE SOME
          OTHER UNDESIRABLE AFFECT and may not be supported, it is the nature
          of some of these files to be changed to reflect various users' needs.

          As any non-trivial thing written, these files are copyrighted; they
          are copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any other people wherein
          noted, who wrote them.

          These files are licensed under any "do whatever you want with"
          license you can find or create; they are provided without any
          restriction.

ttylinux-build/pkg-cfg/ Files
-----------------------------

In several of the various directories in ttylinux-build/pkg-cfg/ there is a
file named rootfs.tar.bz2; this is a compressed tar-file that has one or more
files that will reside in a bootable ttylinux system (this is called the
run-time system to distinguish it from the ttylinux build-system).  In the
ttylinux run-time system these files are, but not limited to be:

=> configuration files in /etc/ and its subdirectories
=> (sys init scripts) shell scripts in /etc/rc.d/ and its subdirectories
=> /sbin/ttylinux-flash
=> /sbin/ttylinux-installer
=> /usr/bin/pacman
=> /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script

For the configuration files, see the NOTICE in this section above.

These ttylinux run-time scripts are copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any
other people wherein noted, who wrote them.  These files are licensed under the
GPL Version 2 (June 1991), not version 2.2 or version 3.x or any other version,
unless explicitly otherwise stated.

        --------------------------------------------------

4. ttylinux test scripts

These are all the files used to _test_ a ttylinux system that are developed
by the ttylinux project; these are not the files that are delivered with a
bootable ttylinux system such as CD-ROM image or other tar-file.  These files
include, but are not limited to:

=> files in ttylinux-build/test directory

As any non-trivial thing written, these files are copyrighted; they are
copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any other people wherein noted, who wrote
them.  These files are licensed under any "do whatever you want with" license
you can find or create; they are provided without any restriction.

        --------------------------------------------------

5. ttylinux documentation

NOTICE -> The various "how to" and help files in the ttylinux-build/ directory
          are as any non-trivial thing written, these files are copyrighted;
          they are copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any other people wherein
          noted, who wrote them.  These files are licensed under any "do
          whatever you want with" license you can find or create; they are
          provided without any restriction.

The ttylinux change logs, specific "how to" documents, and the ttylinux User
Guide are files that include, but are not limited to:

=> change log files in the ttylinux-build/doc/
=> ttylinux-build/doc/Flash_Disk_Howto.txt
=> ttylinux-build/doc/User_Guide.html
=> ttylinux-build/doc/User_Guide.pdf
=> ttylinux-build/doc/User_Guide.tex
