===============
1. Introduction
===============

This short document describes how to report bugs, make requests and suggestions,
and otherwise how to help ttylinux.


=================================
2. Background (READ THIS SECTION)
=================================

ttylinux is an exercise in minimalism.

ttylinux is very small.  The goal is to keep ttylinux simple, small, and
hopefully extensible.  ttylinux development has a clear distinction between
growth and change (generally do not want) and bug fixes (do want).

----------------------
2.1. Growth and Change
----------------------

Most software projects, as does the ttylinux project, have a goal to make their
product better and keep it as up-to-date with the latest methods and techniques
as possible.  Usually there is a corresponding expectation of growth and
increasing complexity in their code base and end product.  Each project has its
own balance of up-to-date features, size and complexity.  Simplicity and small
size are ttylinux goals.  For ttylinux to stay small, requests and suggestions
that are separate from bug fixes for improvements and things to make it better
are very critically analyzed: what things are better and what is the cost in
size?

=> Kernel configuration updates for improving capabilities are always welcome.

=> New package config directories, for new packages in pkg-cfg/, with their
   build scripts ARE probably WELCOME, as they do not necessarily need to be
   included in the standard released binary distributions.

--------------
2.2. Bug Fixes
--------------

A *problem* is different from a *fix*; state what the problem is, even if you
have thought of a fix.  If the box flew off the table then say "the box flies
off the table", do not say "you need to nail the box to the table", as the
right fix may be to balance some moving part in the box.

=> Problem statements are always welcome.

=> Fixes are always welcome.


======================================
3. Questions, Requests and Suggestions
======================================

If you have some question(s) about using ttylinux, or some general ttylinux
question, then:

     FIRST - read the ttylinux User Guide at http://ttylinux.net/docs.html

     then, if you still have questions or need more information, email the
     ttylinux mail list:  ttylinux@googlegroups.com
                          http://groups.google.com/group/ttylinux/

If you have an idea for a kernel configuration improvement or existing package
configuration improvement, then you should send email describing the change to
the ttylinux mail list.

Otherwise, first read section 2 of this document, then email your thoughts to
the ttylinux mail list:
     ttylinux@googlegroups.com
     http://groups.google.com/group/ttylinux/


====================
4. Run-time Problems
====================

If you find a problem while using a ttylinux distribution, collect this
information:
        -- ttylinux version number
        -- ttylinux platform and CPU (pc_i486, mac_g4, etc.)
        -- problem statement: describe what is the symptom
        -- (option) proposed fix: describe what you think is the fix
        -- (option) software patch, if less than 25 kbytes ** (see below)

Email this information to the ttylinux mail list:
     ttylinux@googlegroups.com
     http://groups.google.com/group/ttylinux/

** - Not everyone has high-speed Internet access; some folks may have no more
     than 5 KB/sec download.  If you have a large patch then don't post it to
     the mail list, just say in your post that you have a large patch and let
     me arrange to get it from you.


======================
5. Build-time Problems
======================

Do not ask me to pull from your git repo unless we have arranged to work
together on something.  Bug fixes should be given as one or more small patch in
the mail list, if at all feasible.

If you find a problem while building ttylinux, collect this information:
        -- ttylinux version number in the Makefile, before you changed it
        -- COMPRESSED platform config file: ttylinux-config.sh, if changed
        -- kernel config file, if applicable and you changed it ** (see below)
        -- problem statement: describe what is the symptom
        -- (option) proposed fix: describe what you think is the fix
        -- (option) software patch, if less than 25 kbytes ** (see below)

Email this information to the ttylinux mail list:
     ttylinux@googlegroups.com
     http://groups.google.com/group/ttylinux/

** - Not everyone has high-speed Internet access; some folks may have no more
     than 5 KB/sec download.  If you have an applicable kernel config file or
     a large patch then don't post it to the mail list, just say in your post
     that you have such and let me arrange to get it from you.

For xbuildtool problems, do something similar to what is described in this
section.


================
6. Major Updates
================

If you have something like:

=> new build package for the pkg-cfg/ directory
=> new platform for the config/ directory
=> new bootloader for the bootloader/ directory

then email a description to the ttylinux mail list:
     ttylinux@googlegroups.com
     http://groups.google.com/group/ttylinux/
