1. Preface
==========

Caveat:  The syslinux method has been known to work with syslinux-3.72 and
         syslinux-4.05.

Caveat:  Instead of booting ttylinux, your flash drive may become unusable, but
         that is not known to have happened.

Advice:  Read before doing; reading does not take very long.  Look at the end
         of this short document for problems and possible resolutions.


===============
2. Introduction
===============

Flash drives include USB drives which are often called flash disks, pen drives,
USB memory sticks, travel drives, etc.

This file describes two methods of copying ttylinux from its bootable CD-ROM
and putting it onto a flash drive that is also made bootable.  These methods
probably only make sense on a Linux system, particularly the lilo method.  The
syslinux and lilo methods both can be done by ttylinux, but notice the syslinux
executable program that makes the flash drive become bootable is not in the
ttylinux file system, it is on the ttylinux CD-ROM.

You should save all your data on the flash drive to somewhere else and then
remove all files and directories from the drive, as making a mistake in this
process can endanger all data on the drive.  Also, if the Linux kernel is too
far from the beginning of the drive (because of files already on the drive) it
may not be bootable; this has nothing to do with where the file name is in a
directory listing or in Windows explorer.

You can format the flash drive to be a Linux file system, but leaving a USB
flash drive in Windows format, probably vfat aka W95 FAT32, is very convenient.

Prerequisites:  Depending upon the method you use, you need to have privilege
                to write the flash drive device (e.g. /dev/sdc) and to write its
                mountable partitions (e.g. /dev/sdc1), and with the lilo method
                you need to create a device node.  It is therefore very likely
                you need to be root.

                You need to *know* the flash drive device node e.g., /dev/sdc,
                and its mountable partition that you want to use e.g.,
                /dev/sdc1.  Read the previous sentence again, note the
                distinction between the disk and partition devices.

In the following descriptions <disk> and <partition> are used to represent
device nodes in the /dev directory.

<disk> is the device node of the entire flash drive e.g., sdc, in which case
       /dev/<disk> represents /dev/sdc.

<partition> is the device node of the mountable partition on the flash drive
            that you want to use to store the Linux kernel and ttylinux file
            system e.g., sdc1, in which case /dev/<partition> represents
            /dev/sdc1.

In the following descriptions, /mnt/flash references the mount point in your
file system to which the flash drive mounts.  Your actual mount point may be
different, substitute accordingly.

A flash drive partition probably should be mounted with the following mount
command.  The second command gives you the UUID of the mounted partition, it
may not work, but if it does then write it down or otherwise save the UUID.

     $ mount -t vfat /dev/<partition> /mnt/flash
     $ blkid /dev/<partition>

/mnt/cdrom represents the location of the mounted CD-ROM in the following
descriptions.

Have the ttylinux boot CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive and mount it.  The CD-ROM
should be mounted as type iso9660 e.g., mounted by the following command.

     $ mount -t iso9660 /dev/<disk> /mnt/cdrom

If you have an image of the ttylinux CD-ROM mounted via loopback device, or
have the files from the ttylinux CD-ROM in some another directory, you can use
that.

In the following descriptions there are example commands; they are prefixed by
a shell prompt of "$ ", and comments to shell commands begin with the shell
comment character '#".


==============
3. Lilo Method
==============

Warning:  After performing this method subsequent uses of the syslinux method
          may have NO affect, or make a system that boots with odd errors, or
          the lilo boot loader may stay on the flash drive and continue to boot
          the kernel.
          I've never seen the syslinux method work after using this lilo
          method.  There is a way to fix this; it is described at the end of
          the syslinux method.

Mount the flash drive.  The following description uses /mnt/flash to reference
the mount point of the flash drive.  Did you remember to first save everything
you want to keep from the flash drive and remove everything from it?  After
mounting the flash drive, create two new directories named "boot" and "config"
on the flash drive.

     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/boot
     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/config
     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/doc

The flash drive should now have nothing on it except the two empty directories
just made, /boot and /config.

Copy the ttylinux Linux kernel and ttylinux file system image from the CD-ROM
onto the flash drive; put them into the boot directory.

     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/boot/vmlinuz    /mnt/flash/boot/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/boot/filesys.gz /mnt/flash/boot/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/config/*        /mnt/flash/config/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/doc/*           /mnt/flash/doc/

You need a ram0 device node for lilo to reference during the boot installation.
If you don't have one in /dev then you need to make one somewhere; it is better
to NOT make one in /dev in the case your system uses udev.  You can make one in
/tmp with the following command.

     $ mknod -m 660 /tmp/ram0 b 1 0

A lilo configuration file is needed.  It is convenient to put it on the flash
drive in the boot directory; the file is /mnt/flash/boot/lilo.conf.  Use the
following example lilo.conf file, changing <disk> and </mnt/flash> and
</dev/ram0> to be the actual values.  Use ttylinux-flash=<UUID> ONLY if you got
the UUID when previously mounting the USB drive partition, replacing <UUID>
with the actual UUID value.

The location of the ram0 device is the actual one you want to use; if you
didn't create one then it probably is /dev/ram0.

Everything between the dashed lines is the /mnt/flash/boot/lilo.conf file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
boot = /dev/<disk>
disk = /dev/<disk> bios=0x80
map  = </mnt/flash>/boot/map

install     = menu
menu-scheme = Yb:Yk:kb:Yb
menu-title  = "LILO (LInux LOader) boot ttylinux"

compact
default = ttylinux
lba32
prompt
timeout = 150

image=</mnt/flash>/boot/vmlinuz
     append = "ro ttylinux-flash=<UUID>"
     label  = ttylinux
     root   = </dev/ram0>
     initrd = </mnt/flash>/boot/filesys.gz
     read-only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the lilo.conf file is correct, execute lilo to make the flash drive
bootable with these two commands.

     $ lilo -M /dev/<disk> mbr
     $ lilo -C /mnt/flash/boot/lilo.conf

There probably are many possible problems.  If there were no FATAL problems
reported from lilo, unmount and reboot the flash drive.

----------------
Possible Problem
----------------

Lilo may detect a partition problem and give you message like the following:

     Warning: boot record relocation beyond BPB is necessary: /dev/sdc
     Added ttylinux *
     Fatal: LILO internal error:  Would overwrite Partition Table

--------------------
Possible Resolutions
--------------------

If you have this problem you may want to do one of the following:

=> If you are using a USB drive then you can use a Windows-based USB boot drive
   tool; several are freely available.

=> Use a commercial partition tool to fix the flash drive partition table.

=> Use a different flash drive.


==================
4. Syslinux Method
==================

You need to have the syslinux executable program.  The root directory of the
ttylinux CD-ROM should have a syslinux executable program.

Other syslinux sources: You may have it in your current Linux distribution.  Or
you can get the latest version from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/ and after untarring it,
find the syslinux executable in the Linux directory.

Caveat:  The syslinux method is only known by the author to work with
         syslinux-3.72 and syslinux-4.05; it probably works with other
         versions.

Mount the flash drive.  The following description uses /mnt/flash to reference
the mount point of the flash drive.  Did you remember to first save everything
you want to keep from the flash drive and remove everything from it?  The flash
drive should now have nothing on it.

The following lilo fixup also fixes many USB drives that do not properly boot.

If you are doing this with a flash drive that previously was booting from a lilo
boot loader e.g., you previously used the above lilo method, then perform this
lilo operation before continuing:

     $ lilo -M /dev/<disk> mbr

After mounting the flash drive, create some new directories on the flash drive:

     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/boot
     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/boot/syslinux
     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/config
     $ mkdir /mnt/flash/doc

Copy the syslinux help message files from the CD-ROM onto the flash drive.
Copy the ttylinux Linux kernel and ttylinux file system image files from the
CD-ROM onto the flash drive:

     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/boot/vmlinuz            /mnt/flash/boot/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/boot/filesys.gz         /mnt/flash/boot/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/boot/isolinux/boot.msg  /mnt/flash/boot/syslinux/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/boot/isolinux/help*.msg /mnt/flash/boot/syslinux/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/config/*                /mnt/flash/config/
     $ cp /mnt/cdrom/doc/*                   /mnt/flash/doc/

A syslinux configuration file is needed.  It must be put on the flash drive in
the boot/syslinux directory; the file is /mnt/flash/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg.
Use the following example syslinux.cfg file.  Use ttylinux-flash=<UUID> ONLY if
you got the UUID when previously mounting the USB drive partition, replacing
<UUID> with the actual UUID value.  Everything between the dashed lines is the
/mnt/flash/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default ttylinux
display boot.msg
prompt  1
timeout 150

F1 boot.msg
F2 help_f2.msg
F3 help_f3.msg
F4 help_f4.msg

label ttylinux
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz
        append initrd=/boot/filesys.gz root=/dev/ram0 ro ttylinux-flash=<UUID>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now make the flash drive bootable with syslinux; notice the partition device is
used, not the disk device.

     $ syslinux -d boot/syslinux /dev/<partition>

There probably are many possible problems.  If there were no problems, unmount
and reboot the flash drive.

----------------
Possible Problem
----------------

When executing the syslinux command you see an error message something like
"Cluster sizes larger than 16K not supported".

--------------------
Possible Resolutions
--------------------

Install a more recent version of syslinux.

5. Automated Help
=================

It really is best to use the bash script "ttylinux-flash" described herein.

The bash script "ttylinux-flash", henceforth referred to as ttylinux-flash,
puts either the lilo or syslinux as the boot loader with ttylinux on the USB
drive; the ttylinux-flash options used to indicate lilo and syslinux are
"-l" (or "--lilo") and "-s" (or "--syslinux"), respectively.

For this to work you need both:

     a) The flash drive must be mounted.

     b) The CD-ROM files must be available in the right directories, which is
        easily done by having the CD-ROM mounted.  If you have an file image of
        the ttylinux CD-ROM mounted via loopback device, or have the files from
        the ttylinux CD-ROM in some another directory, you can use that.

This shell script is in the ttylinux file system, so ttylinux itself is capable
of making a bottable USB drive with ttylinux.

There are at least two ways to use ttylinux-flash:

     1) Run ttylinux-flash in a booted ttylinux.

     2) Run ttylinux-flash in some other Linux host with a mounted ttylinux
        CD-ROM.  ttylinux-flash is one of the files on the ttylinux CD-ROM, so
        your Linux host uses it from there and doesn't need it to be previously
        installed.  Since the mounted ttylinux CD-ROM is used a source of
        files, this can actually be a file image of the ttylinux CD-ROM mounted
        via loopback device or simply the files from the ttylinux CD-ROM in
        some another directory.

     3) A variation of 2 above is to run ttylinux-flash on the Linux host on
        which you've just build a ttylinux image.  The build/cdrom directory
        contains the CD-ROM mastering image source files, including the Linux
        kernel and file system image.  The ttylinux-flash script is in the
        sysroot/sbin/ directory.

Backup anything you want to keep from your flash drive before using the
ttylinux-flash script.  The script is invoked with a command line option
telling it which method to use; guess which option does which.

ttylinux-flash --lilo     <CD-ROM path> <flash drive path> <flash drive device>
ttylinux-flash --syslinux <CD-ROM path> <flash drive path> <flash drive device>

<CD-ROM path> .......... is the directory that has the ttylinux CD-ROM files,
                         such as the directory where the ttylinux CD-ROM is
                         mounted.

<flash drive path> ..... is the directory where the flash drive is mounted;
                         this directory must be empty.

<flash drive device> ... is the disk block devices of the mounted flash drive;
                         this is the whole disk block device node such as
                         /dev/sdc, and NOT a partition block device node like
                         /dev/sdc1.

The following command examples use the same conventions as the above sections
of this document for the flash drive and CD-ROM paths and device nodes.

Mount the flash drive and the CD-ROM, if needed, as described above in section
"2. Introduction".

Examples:

     From a CD-ROM-booted ttylinux system, if you have a USB drive partition
     mounted at /mnt/flash on device /dev/sda1 and the CD-ROM mounted on
     /mnt/cdrom, then try one of the following commands.

     $ ttylinux-flash -l         /mnt/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sda
     $ ttylinux-flash --syslinux /mnt/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sda

Examples:

     On your host system, if you have a USB drive partition mounted at
     /mnt/flash on device /dev/sdb1 and the CD-ROM mounted on /mnt/cdrom, then
     try one of the following commands.

     $ /mnt/cdrom/config/ttylinux-flash --lilo /mnt/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sdb
     $ /mnt/cdrom/config/ttylinux-flash -s     /mnt/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sdb

Examples:

     On your host system, you have just built ttylinux and you have a USB drive
     partition mounted at /mnt/flash on device /dev/sdb1, then try one of the
     following commands.

     You can run ttylinux-flash from the build sysroot:
     $ sysroot/sbin/ttylinux-flash -l build/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sdb
     $ sysroot/sbin/ttylinux-flash -s build/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sdb

     Or you can run ttylinux-flash from the CD-ROM staging area:
     $ build/cdrom/config/ttylinux-flash -l build/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sdb
     $ build/cdrom/config/ttylinux-flash -s build/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sdb


================
6. Boot Problems
================

General
-------

Some flash drives seem to have a boot problem, something wrong with their zero
block Master Boot Record (MBR).  Run fdisk on the disk device /dev/<disk> to
see if the Boot flag is set on the partition that has the Linux kernel,
/dev/<partition>.

     # Check for the Boot flag
     #
     fdisk -l /dev/<disk>

If the Boot flag is not set, use fdisk to toggle the bootable flag; the fdisk
command is 'a'.  The fdisk usage will look something like the following, if the
partition with the Linux kernel is 1.

     $ fdisk /dev/<disk>
     Command (m for help): a
     Partition number (1-8): 1
     Command (m for help): w

It also is best to use this lilo command, after having used fdisk to set the
partition bootable flag:

     $ lilo -M /dev/<disk> mbr

Strange Lilo Boot Errors
------------------------

If you get part of the word LILO and then nothing or a repeating sequence of
numbers or words, or if you get "Can't load operating system" or even nothing
at all: put the flash drive back into the computer from wich you where loading
it with ttylinux and try this lilo command:

     $ lilo -M /dev/<disk> mbr

Try bootable again after executing the above command; if the flash drive still
doesn't correctly boot, you may need to repeat either the lilo or syslinux
method of installing ttylinux.
