How to use Debian 6.0 "Squeeze" Lenny for building ttylinux:

=> I installed Debian 6.0.6 with "debian-6.0.6-i386-CD-1.iso", choosing the
   Gnome desktop packages.

=> I found I was missing vim and openssh (to remotely log-in), so interactively
   used /usr/bin/aptitude to get them.  The installation process asked me to
   put in the install CD, so I did.

=> Make sure packages are up-to-date:

   $ apt-get clean all
   $ apt-get update
   $ apt-get upgrade

=> Then, these were the packages I had to get for building ttylinux.  The
   installation process for "make" asked me to put in the install CD, so I did,
   and I left it there.

   $ apt-get install gawk  # The order is important wrt mawk.
   $ apt-get remove mawk   # The order is important wrt gawk.

   $ apt-get install make
   $ apt-get install binutils
   $ apt-get install g++  # This also gets gcc which is needed more than g++.
   $ apt-get install bison
   $ apt-get install bin86
   $ apt-get install autoconf
   $ apt-get install automake
   $ apt-get install libtool

   Maybe use:

   $ apt-get install autoconf automake bin86 binutils bison g++ make

   This is what worked for me; depending upon installation variations you may
   need to install more things.  It doesn't hurt to apt-get something you
   already have, so maybe get the things that will be used:

   $ apt-get install bzip2 flex genisoimage ncurses-dev xz

How to use Debian Lenny for compilling ttylinux:

- Install Debian 5.0.7 from the netinstall.iso, choose only the base packages,
  not the desktop packages etc.
- touch /etc/apt/apt.conf
- vi /etc/apt/apt.conf

     APT::Install-Recommends "0";
     APT::Install-Suggests "0";

- apt-get clean all
- apt-get update
- apt-get upgrade
- apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake bzip2 mkisofs bin86 gawk \
          flex bison ncurses-dev docbook-utils

***** This paragraph is out-of-date [djerome 2012-03-09]:
***** docbook-utils, from my point of view, adds too many additional packages,
***** see this post for how you can compile ttylinux without docbook2man:

I hope this short how to is useful for you!
Happy ttylinux developing/compiling :-)

best regards,
