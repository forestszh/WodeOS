1. Build Problems
=================

-------------------------------------
1.1. ttylinux Build-time awk Problems
-------------------------------------

Only GNU awk will work.  If you have mawk, replace it with GNU awk.
Get the latest gawk tarball at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/
Or Debian:
   $ apt-get install gawk
   $ apt-get remove mawk
Or Fedora:
   $ yum install gawk
   $ yum erase mawk

---------------------------------
1.2. xbuildtools bintuils problem
---------------------------------
-- I don't know for what versions of binutils and ArchLinux this happened;
   maybe this issue is Overcome By Events. [drj]
Weird problem when building under ArchLinux i686 host: "makeinfo" is missing;
it appears to be looking for bfd/docs/*.texi files in the build directory, even
though they are actually in the source directory.  Do this:
   $ mkdir -p bfd/doc
   $ cp -a ../${XBT_BINUTILS}/bfd/doc/* bfd/doc

-----------------------
1.3. lilo Build Problem
-----------------------

You need the dev86 package to build lilo.
Get Dev86src-0.16.18.tar.gz at http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/
http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/Dev86src-0.16.18.tar.gz
Or Debian:
   $ apt-get install bin86
Or Fedora:
   $ yum install dev86


====================
2. Run-time Problems
====================

     This section describes problems that you have when booting or running
     ttylinux.

--------------------------
2.1. bash Run-time Problem
--------------------------

You built ttylinux and find the $(...) construct does not work; you have this
weird bash behavior:

     $ echo $(ls)
     bash: command substitution: line 78: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
     bash: command substitution: line 78: `ls)'

You need to build bash with a better bison (yacc) on your host. bash uses yacc
grammar rules and your yacc does not generate the correct parsing code for the
bash build.
